feature ideas

No promise I'll even attempt these things of course, just some ideas.

base internalization {
  when nobody has voted or all votes have expired
}
internalization of chat members {
  might be fun to have a bot that you can say !internalizationOf [username] to and see your own score
  people jokingly do this sometimes
}
integrate with patreon and weight internalization votes {
  either by current donation amount or by total amount donated
  some base amount for nonpatrons
}
gambling/prediction mode {
  vote with internalization on whether you think this is the run
  moderator (or nick) tells bot whether he succeeded or died
  keep track of people's prediction scores
  error score = (internalization - (if win then 1 else 0))^2 / number of votes
  people could cheat it by voting near the end of the run but whatever
  could make it so you have a narrow voting window so there's more skill involved in predicting
  would be fairly hard to do and I think most people wouldn't care so I probably won't bother
}
